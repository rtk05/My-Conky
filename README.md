## My Conky

This is my personal Conky setup taken from my laptop. Obviously some things are tailored specifically for my hardware but its very easy to make it your own. Feel free to use and modify this any way you want.

## Installation

* Install conky
* Copy conky.conf to your conky config directory (typically /usr/yourname/.config/conky)

## Credits

Many parts of this are copied from other Conky presets and Stack Overflow. I take no credit aside from combining many other ideas.
